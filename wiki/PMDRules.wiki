PMD Rules to Ignore

OnlyOneReturn - just don't deeply nest returns. Make control flow easily understandable
MethodArgumentCouldBeFinal - unless you're worried about side effects
LocalVariableCouldBeFinal - unless there is a legitimate reason it needs to be constant
AbstractNaming

And whatever else you feel like. PMD is good for cleanup though!
