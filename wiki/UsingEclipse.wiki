#summary Using Eclipse with the project

= Introduction =

svn:ignore should be set up throughout the repo properly already to ignore anything Eclipse will make.

Checkout a copy of the repo locally however you want. Start Eclipse and create a new project. Name it something and point it at the dojo root directory. 

Now adjust so Eclipse doesn't explode on the hidden files in the checkout

At this point Eclipse has probably totally f*cked up your repo. Run svn up and then svn status. If you see "? (directory)" just delete the directory and svn up again until svn status doesn't print anything.

Now you get to fight with Subversion instead of Eclipse! It probably won't restore the deleted directories correctly. Just make a completely fresh checkout somewhere else and copy it over top of the original checkout. Now do an svn up and svn status and hopefully everything is working. Create a Run Configuration that calls dojo.Main and go for it.
